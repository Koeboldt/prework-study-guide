        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> To create a list on a webpage you can use "ol" and "ul" to make ordered or unordered lists respectively.</li>
          <li> For use with lists "li" allows you to put in a list item.</li>
          <li> The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li> The body element represents visible content shown to users.</li>
          <li> HTML elements are case sensitive, but declarations like DOCTYPE are not.</li>
          <li> HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning of an element.</li>
          <li> The title element defines the title for a webpage, the style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website,
             the base element defines the base URL for a webpage, the link element connects an external resource to the HTML document,
             and the script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document. </li>
          <li> The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, descriptions, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li> The element h# with the number being a number between 1 and 6 denotes a header with the size of the content being based on the number with larger numbers being smaller</li>
          <li> The element p represents a paragraph or block of text. Can be used to wrap text on a webpage.</li>
          <li> The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li> The a element allows you to create a hyperlink to the any webpage linked by the href attribute, which points to the URL of the website for the link</li>
          <li> While you can just put bulleted list items without actually containing them in a ul or ol it's not a very good idea, as changes you make to ol/ul with CSS will not apply. I made this mistake for a bit when setting up the CSS then wondered why it wasn't working, turns out I made a blunder.</li>
          <li> Section can be used to partition various pieces of text or imagery on a webpage, and allows you to name a class for a section to allow for easier CSS changes and more.</li>
          <li> Image elements, and CSS must be linked to if they are external. Which images will almost always be.</li>
        </ul>

      </section>
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
        <li> A CSS rule is made up of a selector and a declaration block, with squiggly brackets confining the block. </li>
        <li> The declarations have a property and value, with the property being followed by a colon and the value a semicolon.</li>
        <li> A selector defines the element or attributes that the rules, or declarations will apply.</li>
        <li> The margin property acts as a buffer space that is the space around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li> The padding property works similar to margin but it deals with space around content inside an element.</li>
        <li> You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma.</li>
        <li> Assigning the block value to the display property causes each image to be assigned to a new line.</li>
        <li> The text align property is one of the possible positioning properties, which can be used as a method to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
        <li> If you are using an external CSS style sheet remember to link the file so the CSS is actually applied.</li>
        <li style="color:rgb(255, 0, 191)"><strong>CSS can also be put directly into the code of a file as well through inline CSS which directly changes visual aspects of a single list item or heading. I have changed this one with this method to demonstrate.</strong></li><!-- I bolded it as well to assert my power, Idk it was 2am and I got bored.-->
        <li> Another way is an internal style sheet, which provides CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules will only apply to that page though, with a single change being able to apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
        <li> Important note, while editors can have rgb values named that you can easily pull, you can also just put in your own values if desired with the line rgb then in parenthases the values you wish for r,g,b respectively.</li>
        <li> You can preceed a selector with a period which designates it as a class selector, which will apply the property assignments from the CSS to any HTML element assigned to the class given.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
        <li> The command cd in git means change directory, it can be used to change which directory you're working in.</li>
        <li> The command git status checks what the current branch is and any changes that have been made to it will be shown in case you</li>
        <li> The git command must precede every Git statement.</li>
        <li> The checkout command "git checkout" moves the working branch to a new branch, with -b denoting to create a new branch with the name being whatever follows after the b</li>
        <li> The git add command adds modifications made to the current working branch to the staging area, with the flag -A denoting to add all changes.</li>
        <li> The git commit command creates a commit with the currently staged changes, with -m "" being the message to describe what the commit entails. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONCICELY SAY WHAT YOU ARE DOING.</li>
        <li> The command git pull tells it to receive a branch's changes into the local environment. In the case of "git pull origin main" the origin keyword indicates that the source will be in the GitHub repo, and main indicating the branch being taken.</li>
        <li> The push command allows you to push a branch to GitHub much like the pull allows you to pull from the repo, to do so you'd push origin with whatever follows origin being the name of the branch you want to push.</li>
        <li> Git pull origin main is a useful way to make sure you have the most up to date version of the main if you just pushed an update, because if you are up to date it will tell you.</li>
        <li> It will absolutely not let you change to a different branch unless you commit, no matter what. </li>
        <li> To go up a directory use the command cd ..</li>
        <li> The variable . tells whatever command it's used with to activate in the current directory, and .. causes it to be in the parent directory.</li>

      </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2> JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
        <li> JavaScript is read top to bottom. This is called conrol flow, and different languages can have different control flows.</li>
        <li> A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li> To declare a variable you use the var keyword followed by the name you want to give the variable, then followed by the = sign.</li>
        <li> Each line of JavaScript ends with a semicolon.</li>
        <li> Console.log is a method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument, which in this file it outputs the value of the topics variable.</li>
        <li> It's important to load javascript after the HTML otherwise things can break.</li>
        <li> An if statement will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true. But you can put other conditions in with an else if.</li>
        <li> The strict equality operator "===" checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a boolean result whether the values are equal or not.</li>
        <li> An array is a single variable that holds a group of data, and arrays are not limited to a single type of data.</li>
        <li> To work with individual items within an array you need the location of the data item within the array. This is represented with a unique number called an index.</li>
        <li> JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed and are sequential.</li>
        <li> The first statement of a for loop determines the starting point of the loop. "var x = 0; which gives x the value 0 because 0 is the starting point for the index."</li>
        <li> The second statement is the condition, which determines when the loop will keep running. "x is less than shapes.length; this uses the length property to express the condition."</li>
        <li> The final statement allows the array to iterate each item, basically telling the loop what to do each time it runs. "x++ denotes that it will add 1 every time it loops"</li>
        <li> For loops start with for followed by the statements in parenthases, which is then followed by the code you want exectuted.</li>  
        <li> To comment something out put /* in front of the section you want commented and end the comment with */</li>
        <li> A functions name is followed by () which defines parameters that can be placed, but even if none are placed inside it is still required for a function. </li>
        <li> To create a function you use the function keyword much like you do with variables.</li>
        <li> With functions, if statements, for loops, and other similar things the code is housed in squigly brackets that follow the command.</li>
        <li> Remember to declare your variables first thing, because it will save you a lot of headaches trying to figure out why things don't work.</li>
        <li> The math object can be used to do various things. In this file math.random allows for the variable to be defined as a random index value.</li>
